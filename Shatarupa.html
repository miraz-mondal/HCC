    <u><h3>Sweatshirts</h3></u>
    <p>Starting with the most obvious one – sweatshirts are the easiest clothing piece to work with. If you want to keep your outfit casual, a sweatshirt is your best friend.

    <u><h3>Turtleneck Sweaters</h3></u>
    <p>It’s funny how turtleneck sweaters probably used to be the most undesirable clothing piece in your wardrobe during your childhood. Now, it’s a must-have in your wardrobe to help you doll up for winter in the classiest way. This clothing piece is so versatile that you will want one in every possible color. </p>
    <p>Show off your style and keep yourself warm at the same time with turtleneck sweaters. Even though it has been mentioned earlier that you’ll want this clothing piece in every color, it’s better to start with neutral shades. Invest in brown, white, black, and other earthy tones first and once you have the basics covered, you can start adding fun colors to your closet.</p>

Just like turtleneck sweaters, it’s better to start with neutral shades while investing in trench coats. Go for colors like brown, white, olive green, white, beige, etc to add definition to your wardrobe.

    <u><h3>Fleece Tights</h3></u>
    <p>We all miss wearing skirts and dresses in winters, right? Stockings don’t really seem to protect our legs from extreme cold weather sometimes. So, what’s the way out? Fleece tights! This lesser-known clothing item is making noise all over. You can get fleece tights similar to your complexion and wear your sheer stockings over them to create the best winter looks. No one will ever know the secret and you’ll be the coolest trendsetter this winter.</p>

    <u><h3>Boots</h3></u>
    <p>How can we imagine winters without boots? This piece will add the right amount of sass and class to your winter outfits. Even though there are so many options when it comes to boots, owning at least three types is enough to rock all your outfits. A Chelsea boot is the best if you want something that goes with almost every outfit. If you want to add more details to your look, lace-up boots are the way to go. And lastly, it’s always nice to have a knee-high boot in your wardrobe for those days when you don’t want to put much effort but still want to look presentable.</p>
